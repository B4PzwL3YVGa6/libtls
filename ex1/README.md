### Exercise 1 (Let's talk TLS!)

As you may note, what is in here is exactly what you got for the review exercies

The reason is simple, your task here is to make the client and server here speak
TLS!

For a first step Make the client connect anonymously, and validate the server's certificate.

- Use the root certificate from ../CA/root.pem as the root of trust
- Use the server certificate from ../CA/server.[key|crt] as the server certificate
