### Exercise 2a - nonblocking IO with poll, and TLS

Again, familiarize yourself with the client and echo server in this directory. 

Just as before for 2a, make the client connect anonymously, and validate the server's certificate.

- Use the root certificate from ../CA/root.pem as the root of trust
- Use the server certificate from ../CA/server.[key|crt] as the server certificate

We'll continue on afterward to do further validation.
